This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Development Dependencies

Once you clone this project, add file src/app/api-keys.ts. You will need to create a Firebase account and include your Firebase credentials in this file. Add this file in your .gitignore file (add /src/app/api-keys.ts). In your api-keys.ts file, store credentials in the variable masterFirebaseConfig like this: 

export const masterFirebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "xxxx",
    authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",
    storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "xxxx"
  };

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
